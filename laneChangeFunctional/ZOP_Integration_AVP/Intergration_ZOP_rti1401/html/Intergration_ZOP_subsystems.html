<li>
'Auto' to become an inlined code segment,

<li>
'Auto' to become a non-reusable function without arguments, or

<b>Note:</b>This section does not report graphically identical non-virtual subsystems marked as 'Auto' that were not reused due to differences in their functional properties (such as dimensions, datatypes, work vectors, parameters, etc.).  You may identify reasons for non-reuse in such cases by inspecting the differences in the functional attributes of the subsystems in the model or in the inlined generated code.
